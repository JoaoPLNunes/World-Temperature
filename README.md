This project is a Streamlit-powered dashboard that visualizes historical climate data. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the dashboard allows users to explore the monthly average surface temperature of different countries and continents over the past 85 years.

**Features**

Select a Continent & Country: View temperature trends for specific countries within a continent.
Compare Continents: Analyze temperature differences across continents.
Top 3 Hottest Countries: Identify the three countries with the highest average surface temperature per continent.
Wikipedia Links: Learn more about each countryâ€™s geography and climate.

**Dataset**

This project uses the Average Monthly Surface Temperature (1940-2024) dataset, provided by Samith Sachidanandan on Kaggle. 
Full credit goes to the dataset creator for compiling this valuable resource.
